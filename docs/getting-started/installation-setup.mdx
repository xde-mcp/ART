### Installing ART

The ART client can be installed into projects designed to run on any machine that runs python.

```bash
pip install openpipe-art
```

### Running the client and server locally

The ART server can be run locally on any machine with a GPU. To install the backend dependencies required for training and inference, you can install the `backend` extra:

```bash
pip install openpipe-art[backend]
```



```python
from art import TrainableModel, gather_trajectory_groups
from art.local.backend import LocalBackend

backend = LocalBackend()

model = TrainableModel(
    name="agent-001",
    project="my-agentic-task",
    base_model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct",
)

await model.register(backend)

... the rest of your code ...
```

### Running the client locally and connecting to a remote server

The ART client can also be run locally and connected to a remote server, which ART will automatically provision for you.

```python
from art import TrainableModel, gather_trajectory_groups
from art.skypilot.backend import SkyPilotBackend

backend = await SkyPilotBackend.initialize_cluster(
    cluster_name="my-cluster",
    gpu="H100"
)

model = TrainableModel(
    name="agent-001",
    project="my-agentic-task",
    base_model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct",
)

await model.register(backend)

... the rest of your code ...
```
