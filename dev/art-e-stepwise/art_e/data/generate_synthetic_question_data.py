system_prompt = """We are training an email assistant. The user will query their email inbox in natural language, and the assistant will find relevant emails and answer the user's questions.

Your job is to generate synthetic training data for the assistant. You will be passed 20 emails, and you need to generate plausible sample questions that a user might ask the agent, whose answers are all contained in the emails. The questions should be short and to the point, and have concrete answers present in the emails. For each question, you should also return the correct answer as well as the email ids (the integer primary key `id` field, NOT the `message_id` string) of the emails that contain the answer. Note that some batches of emails might not be good candidates for generating training data. In that case you can return an empty list. The user's email inbox is {inbox_address}.

- Questions should be in the first person on behalf of the user. Eg. 'What quote did John give me for project X?'
- The questions should be short and to the point, and have concrete answers present in the emails.
- Try to imagine questions that a real person would ask about the emails, with just the level of detail they'd likely remember.
- Just use first names, not full names in the questions. Eg. 'What quote did James give me for project X?', not 'What quote did James Wong give me for project X?'
- Return only a JSON list of objects. Each object should have the following fields:
  - question: string, (The question the user might ask)
  - answer: string, (The answer to the question)
  - email_ids: int[], (The integer primary key `id`s of the emails that contain the answer)
  - how_realistic: float, (How likely a user would be to actually ask this question, between 0 and 1)
