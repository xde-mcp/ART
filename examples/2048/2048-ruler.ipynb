    "### How RULER works\n",
    "\n",
    "**RULER** leverages two key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relative scoring is easier than absolute scoring: It’s easier for an LLM to rank several solutions relative to each other than to score them in isolation\n",
    "2. GRPO only needs relative scores: Since GRPO normalizes scores within each group, only the relative rankings matter, not absolute values\n",
    "\n",
    "The process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate N trajectories for a given scenario\n",
    "2. Pass all N trajectories to **RULER**\n",
    "3. **RULER** deduplicates common prefixes (e.g., identical system messages)\n",
    "4. An LLM judge scores each trajectory from 0 to 1 based on goal achievement\n",
    "5. These scores are used directly as rewards in GRPO training\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about **RULER**, check out the [RULER docs](https://art.openpipe.ai/fundamentals/ruler).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Before running the following code, make sure you've set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in [Environment Variables](#Environment-Variables)."
