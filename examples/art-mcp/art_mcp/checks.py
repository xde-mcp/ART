CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{conversation_text}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Did the agent obtain the specific information or perform the actions requested in the task?
2. If the task required multiple steps, were all steps completed?
3. Did the agent provide a meaningful response to the user's request?
4. If the agent encountered errors, did it handle them appropriately and still accomplish the core objective?

Based on the conversation above, determine if the agent successfully completed the task. Consider:
- Whether the core objective was achieved
- If required data was obtained and presented
- Whether any calculations or analysis requested were performed
- If the agent provided useful, accurate information relevant to the task

Respond with only {{"success": true}} if the task was completed successfully, or {{"success": false}} if it was not completed or only partially completed."""
