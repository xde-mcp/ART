## 🔌 MCP•RL: Teach your agents to master MCP

<img src="assets/MCP_RL_diagram.svg" width="7000">

**MCP•RL** enables you to train agents to effectively use any MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with minimal setup. Simply provide a server URL and MCP•RL will:

1. Automatically discover server tools
2. Design input tasks that utilize those tools
3. Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server using RULER
4. Test on new tasks to validate the trained model

✨ **Key Features:**

- **No labeled data** - MCP•RL learns what tasks a server will be used for by analyzing its tools
- **General-purpose** - Optimizes models for any MCP server
- **Strong performance** - Matches or exceeds SOTA performance in 2/3 benchmarks
- **Easy integration** - No customization of your MCP server required!

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## ART Overview

ART is an open-source RL framework that improves agent reliability by allowing LLMs to **learn from experience**. ART provides an ergonomic harness for integrating GRPO into any python application. For a quick hands-on introduction, run one of the notebooks below. When you're ready to learn more, check out the [docs](https://art.openpipe.ai).

[📖 See all blog posts →](https://openpipe.ai/blog)

## Why ART?

- ART provides convenient wrappers for introducing RL training into **existing applications**. We abstract the training server into a modular service that your code doesn't need to interface with.
- **Train from anywhere.** Run the ART client on your laptop and let the ART server kick off an ephemeral GPU-enabled environment, or run on a local GPU.
- Integrations with hosted platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe provide flexible observability and **simplify debugging**.
- ART is customizable with **intelligent defaults**. You can configure training parameters and inference engine configurations to meet specific needs, or take advantage of the defaults, which have been optimized for training efficiency and stability.

## Installation

ART agents can be trained from any client machine that runs python. To add to an existing project, run this command:

```
pip install openpipe-art
```

## 🤖 ART•E Agent

Curious about how to use ART for a real-world task? Check out the [ART•E Agent](https://openpipe.ai/blog/art-e-mail-agent) blog post, where we detail how we trained Qwen 2.5 14B to beat o3 at email retrieval!

## 🔁 Training Loop Overview

ART's functionality is divided into a **client** and a **server**. The OpenAI-compatible client is responsible for interfacing between ART and your codebase. Using the client, you can pass messages and get completions from your LLM as it improves. The server runs independently on any machine with a GPU. It abstracts away the complexity of the inference and training portions of the RL loop while allowing for some custom configuration. An outline of the training loop is shown below:

1. **Inference**

   1. Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow (usually executing several rollouts in parallel to gather data faster).
   2. Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
   3. As the agent executes, each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
   4. When a rollout finishes, your code assigns a `reward` to its Trajectory, indicating the performance of the LLM.

2. **Training**
   1. When each rollout has finished, Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked while training executes.
   2. The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint (or an empty LoRA on the first iteration).
   3. The server saves the newly trained LoRA to a local directory and loads it into vLLM.
   4. Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes at step 1.

This training loop runs until a specified number of inference and training iterations have completed.

## 🧩 Supported Models

ART should work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, or at least the ones supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models). Gemma 3 does not appear to be supported for the time being. If any other model isn't working for you, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues)!
